# Open Electric Car

## What Are We Trying to Do?

The cars we use today lack true innovation, aren't designed with a **safety-first** approach, and aren't modular or customizable. The goal is to build a car that addresses these issues with the following specifications:

- An **electric car for 4 passengers**.
- **Safety-first** design principles.
- 0-100 km/h (0-60 mph) in **less than 5 seconds**.
- A range of at least **400 km** on a single charge.
- End product should cost **less than $40K**.
- **Compliance with regulations** across different countries, ensuring access to a population of **500 million people**.
- Compatibility with **charging networks** in target markets.
- A **modular design** that allows users to customize their car as they see fit.
- **Autonomous driving** capabilities, with the goal of offering **full self-driving** (FSD) functionality in the future.

## Design Principles

### 1. **Safety First**
Safety is a non-negotiable feature, with a focus on making users feel safe both in and around the car.

- **Crash Safety**: The car must meet all international safety standards, including crash tests, structural integrity, airbags, and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). Emphasis is placed on passive safety features like energy-absorbing body panels and active safety features like emergency braking, lane-keeping assistance, and automatic collision avoidance.
- **Security**: Cybersecurity features are essential to prevent hacking or unauthorized access to the car’s software and control systems.

### 2. **Range and Charging Infrastructure**
The goal is to make the car's range and charging as convenient as fueling a gas-powered car.

- **Range**: The car should offer a range that meets or exceeds the needs of most users, with at least **400 km** on a full charge for everyday use. Long-range versions will be available for road trips or larger commutes.
- **Charging Speed and Network**: Speedy charging is crucial to reducing "range anxiety." The car will be compatible with open-source or decentralized charging networks, and there will be systems where users can share home chargers. Compatibility with existing charging infrastructure like Tesla Superchargers, CCS, and CHAdeMO is essential.
- **Home Charging**: The car will be compatible with standard home charging systems for convenient overnight charging.

### 3. **Performance**
The car must provide a driving experience that is both enjoyable and energy-efficient, appealing to a broad audience.

- **Efficient Powertrain**: The electric motor, inverter, and battery system will be optimized to maximize performance and energy efficiency.
- **Handling and Driving Experience**: The car should be fun to drive, with responsive handling, acceleration, and braking.
- **Regenerative Braking**: This feature will not only extend range but also enhance the driving experience and improve energy efficiency.

### 4. **Affordability**
Making electric cars accessible to a broader range of consumers is essential, lowering barriers to entry for new users.

- **Low Production Cost**: Open-source doesn’t just apply to software but also to affordable hardware. The focus is on reducing production costs without compromising safety or performance. Open-source components, like batteries and motors, will be considered.
- **Modular Design**: The car will be modular, allowing users to upgrade parts (such as batteries, wheels, or tech features) rather than replacing the entire car. This reduces long-term costs.
- **Long-Term Cost Efficiency**: The total cost of ownership will be kept low, including charging, maintenance, and repairs.

### 5. **User-Centric Design**
The car should feel like an extension of the driver’s needs and preferences.

- **Comfort and Ergonomics**: The car must be comfortable to drive and ride in, with attention to seating, interior layout, and accessibility.
- **Ease of Use**: The car will feature intuitive controls, a simple user interface for settings, and tech integration such as smartphone connectivity, navigation, and climate control.
- **Customization**: Users will be able to personalize aspects of the car, like interior materials, color schemes, and display layouts.

### 6. **Sustainability and Environmental Impact**
The car will align with sustainability goals, contributing to a broader eco-conscious movement.

- **Materials**: Recyclable or sustainable materials will be used in construction, including eco-friendly interior materials, lightweight composites, and recyclable body panels. A closed-loop system will be considered, where components are easily repurposed at the end of the car’s life cycle.
- **Battery Recycling**: Strategies for responsible battery recycling or reuse will be developed, addressing one of the largest environmental concerns with electric vehicles (EVs).
- **Energy Source**: Solar panel integration and collaborations with renewable energy providers for charging stations and home charging setups will be encouraged.

### 7. **Global Scalability**
The car must be adaptable and attractive to users around the world, especially in regions where EV adoption is still growing.

- **Compatibility with Various Markets**: The car will be designed to meet the needs of users in various regions, considering factors like urban vs. rural, hot vs. cold climates, and developing vs. developed markets.
- **Affordability in Emerging Markets**: The design and price point will be crafted to make the car attractive to consumers in developing countries, where vehicle costs are a major barrier.

### 8. **Open-Source Software and Community Involvement**
A community will be built around the car that embraces innovation, collaboration, and shared learning.

- **Customizable Software**: Users and developers will be able to modify or enhance the car’s software (e.g., infotainment, navigation, vehicle diagnostics), fostering innovation and community-driven improvements.
- **Transparency**: Access to software and hardware schematics will be provided so third-party developers can create tools, apps, or modifications.
- **Collaboration with Developers**: A community of open-source contributors will be encouraged to suggest or build features. The platform will integrate with other open-source tech projects like renewable energy, autonomous vehicles, or shared mobility.

### 9. **Autonomy and Full Self-Driving (FSD)**
The car will be equipped with autonomous driving capabilities, with a goal of offering full self-driving features.

- **Autonomous Features**: Features like adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, automated parking, and emergency intervention systems will be introduced for safer, more convenient driving experiences.
- **Full Self-Driving (FSD)**: As technology advances, the car will strive to offer **full self-driving** (FSD) functionality, reducing human intervention and increasing road safety.
- **Connected Car**: The car will be a hub of connectivity, with over-the-air updates, smart navigation, diagnostics, and integration with other smart devices (e.g., home automation, smart charging).

### 10. **Maintenance and Repairability**
Users will be empowered to maintain their own vehicles, reducing dependency on dealerships or specialized service centers.

- **Open-Source Documentation**: Repair manuals, schematics, and diagnostic tools will be made available, so users can perform their own maintenance or find local mechanics who can help.
- **Low Maintenance**: The car will be designed for minimal maintenance. Electric vehicles typically require less upkeep than combustion engine cars, but easily replaceable parts and accessible systems will still be prioritized.

## Roadmap
